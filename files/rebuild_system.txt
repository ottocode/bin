Guide for me to rebuild Ubuntu.
This may also work for other linux distros, but some of the particulars will be different.
More to come as needed.
Feel free to comment on alternate / more standard ways to do these things

Install the following:

sudo apt-get install vim
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended



Other stuff:
1. uninstall/reinstall gnome terminal to get it to show up in launcher (Ubuntu may fix this in later patches)

2. make a git directory and:
    git clone https://github.com/ottocode/bin.git

3. Add to the bottom of ~/.bashrc 
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/git/bin
    export PATH

4. OUTDATED  just do "normalizeVim" (from bin)
    create ~/.vimrc file and add
        set expandtab
        set tabstop=4
        set shiftwidth=4
        map <F2> :retab <CR> :w <CR>

5. Install tor browser
    Install the browser in the folder specified in the Exec field below

6. Create a desktop icon for it, then lock it to launcher.
    Add tor.desktop to desktop folder.  Put the following in it:
        [Desktop Entry]
        Name=Tor Browser
        Exec=/home/acer/applications/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser
        StartupNotify=true
        Terminal=false
        Type=Application
        Icon=/home/acer/applications/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/icons/mozicon128.png
    Anyone know where to find the actual icon?
